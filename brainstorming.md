## Evaluation of Top 3
1. Travel Journal App
* Mobile: Users would be able to use their device’s camera to take photos and upload them. The app would have push notifications of new or popular activities to discover nearby, using their location, and also posts similar to what the user has interacted with. 
* Story: This app is essentially a travel diary for users to reflect on their travels. For anyone who travels, being able to have a personal time capsule of the places they have visited is an invaluable way to preserve memory. For the avid traveler, this is a great way to document their experiences and seamlessly organize photos using location and time. I think my friends would love the idea of seeing where other friends have traveled, they are able to get reliable recommendations and eventually share their unique experiences by planning through the app. 
* Market: This app is directed to anyone who travels, therefore everyone. Whether a user travels within their state, country or internationally, they can utilize this app to log their journey. There are a lot of travel apps available, but none have integrated budgeting, media and geolocation. 
* Habit: We live in the age of social media where people want to showcase their lives and experiences and also consume media from people of interest. To increase addictiveness and potential habit formation, the introduction of a travel stamp (like in a passport) is introduced. Travel stamps are awarded when the user has visited certain locations or hit certain milestones. Having a good UX and UI design will also encourage users to frequent the app. Users may open the app more frequently to view other travelogues and get ideas for their next visit than they do to create posts.
* Scope: A stripped down version of the app is still very appealing to build and that is what we hope to achieve by the end of the program. Focusing on the core functionality, we want to implement geolocation services, user authentication and multimedia integration while using travel booking APIs like Duffel API Quick Start Collection | Duffel | Postman API Network for flights and BookingAPI | Get Started | Postman API Network for hotels. 
Google Maps Platform – Core APIs | Get Started | Postman API Network

2. Art Inspiration App
* Mobile: This app would make use of the phone’s touch screen to allow users to paint different colors and compositions to query for similar works of art to use as inspiration
* Story: At a time where AI art is becoming more known, this app stands out by being an inspirational force for artists rather than being a generator itself. The audience for this app would generally be artists, but could also be used by people who are interested in art or learning to create art. 
* Market: This app is maybe more on the niche side, but could be very useful to artists who regularly seek out inspiration for their pieces or like to be able to study art.
* Habit: The intention of the app isn’t to be addictive, but to provide the user with inspiration based on their inputs. In this way, the app could be used often but in an intentional way rather than being addictive by design.
* Scope: An existing API, https://www.artpi.co/how-it-works, would allow for us to already have the functionality of visually searching for art from a database, however we would have to implement the function of drawing on the screen and using that drawing to query the API, which could potentially be very challenging. 

3. Video Game Tracker App
* Mobile: This app would make use of push notifications to alert the user as to when a video game they’re interested in is going to be released. It shows them nearby stores that carry the video game, making use of location.
* Story: For those who like to game, it can often be difficult to keep track of all the upcoming game releases they’re interested in. In addition, the more dedicated fans may want to have a countdown to a release date if they’ve been looking forward to a particular game for years. This app functions as a one-stop shop for many things related to gaming, from buying the game, to playing it with interactive reviewing and journaling features, so users can keep track of their thoughts or jot down quick notes about difficult puzzles.
* Market: The app may be somewhat niche in that only dedicated video game hobbyists would find use in it, but the inverse is true in that some casual fans may find its game-tracking functions to be helpful when they’re not as attentive to the news. So, it could potentially appeal to a wide range of video game audiences.
* Habit: The app isn’t necessarily meant to be addictive, but the user may end up keeping it open for extended periods of time if they are gaming and using it as a note-taker. The user both consumes and creates through the note and review-taking features.
* Scope: This app will be somewhat easier than the others, with the user inputting game titles they’re interested in and the app displaying news related to it through websites like Kotaku or showing reviews through Metacritic. The main page is a news feed directly tailored to a user’s interests in games. The other features include displaying a store nearby that carries the game, a countdown to an upcoming game’s release, note pages, progress bars to track game time, and pages for reviews of finished games.
